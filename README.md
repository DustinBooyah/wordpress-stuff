# wordpress-stuff
I've decided to keep the files I create while working on Wordpress stuff in this repo. 

It'll help with version control and also keep my github busy :) but most importantly, I'm learning.

Basically, I'm having trouble getting permission to set up local environments for a couple of Wordpress builds. These aren't builds that I've created, but builds that I've inherited one way or another. I prever to edit the code in an actual IDE instead of Wordpress, so I'm keeping track here.
